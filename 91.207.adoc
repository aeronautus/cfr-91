. Each emergency locator transmitter required by paragraph (a) of this section must be attached to the airplane in such a manner that the probability of damage to the transmitter in the event of crash impact is minimized. Fixed and deployable automatic type transmitters must be attached to the airplane as far aft as practicable.

. Each emergency locator transmitter required by paragraph (a) of this section must be inspected within 12 calendar months after the last inspection for—
[arabic]
.. Proper installation;
.. Battery corrosion;
.. Operation of the controls and crash sensor; and
.. The presence of a sufficient signal radiated from its antenna.
. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a person may—
[arabic]
.. Ferry a newly acquired airplane from the place where possession of it was taken to a place where the emergency locator transmitter is to be installed; and
.. Ferry an airplane with an inoperative emergency locator transmitter from a place where repairs or replacements cannot be made to a place where they can be made.

.. Aircraft while engaged in scheduled flights by scheduled air carriers;
.. Aircraft while engaged in training operations conducted entirely within a 50-nautical mile radius of the airport from which such local flight operations began;

[lowerroman]
... No person may operate the aircraft unless the aircraft records contain an entry which includes the date of initial removal, the make, model, serial number, and reason for removing the transmitter, and a placard located in view of the pilot to show “ELT not installed.”
... No person may operate the aircraft more than 90 days after the ELT is initially removed from the aircraft; and
.. On and after January 1, 2004, aircraft with a maximum payload capacity of more than 18,000 pounds when used in air transportation.
