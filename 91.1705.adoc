.. That person's logbook has been endorsed in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
. Except as provided in § 91.1703(b), no person may manipulate the controls, act as pilot in command, or act as second-in-command, of a Mitsubishi MU-2B series airplane for the purpose of flight unless—
[arabic]
.. That person satisfactorily completes, if applicable, annual Recurrent pilot training on the *Special Emphasis Items,* and all items listed in the *Training Course Final Phase Check* in accordance with an FAA approved MU-2B training program that meets the standards of this subpart; and
.. That person's logbook has been endorsed in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
. Satisfactory completion of the competency check required by § 135.293 of this chapter within the preceding 12 calendar months may not be substituted for the Mitsubishi MU-2B series airplane annual recurrent flight training of this section.
. Satisfactory completion of a Federal Aviation Administration sponsored pilot proficiency program, as described in § 61.56(e) of this chapter may not be substituted for the Mitsubishi MU-2B series airplane annual recurrent flight training of this section.
. If a person complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section in the calendar month before or the calendar month after the month in which compliance with these paragraphs are required, that person is considered to have accomplished the training requirement in the month the training is due.
. The endorsement required under paragraph (a) and (b) of this section must be made by—
[arabic]
.. A certificated flight instructor or a simulator instructor authorized by a Training Center certificated under part 142 of this chapter and meeting the qualifications of § 91.1713; or
.. For persons operating the Mitsubishi MU-2B series airplane for a 14 CFR part 119 certificate holder within the last 12 calendar months, the part 119 certificate holder's flight instructor if authorized by the FAA and if that flight instructor meets the requirements of § 91.1713.
. All training conducted for a Mitsubishi MU-2B series airplane must be completed in accordance with an MU-2B series airplane checklist that has been accepted by the Federal Aviation Administration's MU-2B Flight Standardization Board or the applicable MU-2B series checklist (incorporated by reference, see § 91.1721).
. MU-2B training programs must contain ground training and flight training sufficient to ensure pilot proficiency for the safe operation of MU-2B aircraft, including:
[arabic]
.. A ground training curriculum sufficient to ensure pilot knowledge of MU-2B aircraft, aircraft systems, and procedures, necessary for safe operation; and
              
.. Flight training curriculum including flight training maneuver profiles sufficient in number and detail to ensure pilot proficiency in all MU-2B operations for each MU-2B model in correlation with MU-2B limitations, procedures, aircraft performance, and MU-2B Cockpit Checklist procedures applicable to the MU-2B model being trained. A MU-2B training program must contain, at a minimum, the following flight training maneuver profiles applicable to the MU-2B model being trained:
[lowerroman]
... Normal takeoff with 5- and 20- degrees flaps;
... Takeoff engine failure with 5- and 20- degrees flaps;
... Takeoff engine failure on runway or rejected takeoff;
... Takeoff engine failure after liftoff—unable to climb (may be completed in classroom or flight training device only);
... Steep turns;
... Slow flight maneuvers;
... One engine inoperative maneuvering with loss of directional control;
... Approach to stall in clean configuration and with wings level;
... Approach to stall in takeoff configuration with 15- to 30- degrees bank;
... Approach to stall in landing configuration with gear down and 40-degrees of flaps;
... Accelerated stall with no flaps;
... Emergency descent at low speed;
... Emergency descent at high speed;
... Unusual attitude recovery with the nose high;
... Unusual attitude recovery with the nose low;
... Normal landing with 20- and 40- degrees flaps;
... Go around and rejected landing;
... No flap or 5- degrees flaps landing;
... One engine inoperative landing with 5- and 20- degrees flaps;
... Crosswind landing;
... Instrument landing system (ILS) and missed approach ;
... Two engine missed approach;
... One engine inoperative ILS and missed approach;
... One engine inoperative missed approach;
... Non-precision and missed approach;
... Non-precision continuous descent final approach and missed approach;
... One engine inoperative non-precision and missed approach;
... One engine inoperative non-precision CDFA and missed approach;
... Circling approach at weather minimums;
... One engine inoperative circling approach at weather minimums.
.. Flight training must include a final phase check sufficient to document pilot proficiency in the flight training maneuver profiles at the completion of training; and
.. Differences training for applicable MU-2B model variants sufficient to ensure pilot proficiency in each model operated. Current MU-2B differences requirements are specified in § 91.1707(c). A person must complete Differences training if a person operates more than one MU-2B model as specified in § 91.1707(c). Differences training between the factory type design K and M models of the MU-2B airplane, and the factory type design J and L models of the MU-2B airplane, may be accomplished with Level A training. All other factory type design differences training must be accomplished with Level B training unless otherwise specified in § 91.1707(c) . A Level A or B differences training is not a recurring annual requirement. Once a person has completed Initial Level A or B Differences training between the applicable different models, no additional differences training between those models is required.
.. Icing training sufficient to ensure pilot knowledge and safe operation of the MU-2B aircraft in icing conditions as established by the FAA;
.. Ground and flight training programs must include training hours identified by § 91.1707(a) for ground instruction, § 91.1707(b) for flight instruction, and § 91.1707(c) for differences training.
[lowerroman]
... No training credit is given for second-in-command training and no credit is given for right seat time under this program. Only the sole manipulator of the controls of the MU-2B airplane, flight training device, or Level C or D simulator can receive training credit under this program;
... An MU-2B airplane must be operated in accordance with an FAA approved MU-2B training program that meets the standards of this subpart and the training hours in § 91.1707.
.. Endorsements given for compliance with paragraph (f) of this section must be appropriate to the content of that specific MU-2B training program's compliance with standards of this subpart.
