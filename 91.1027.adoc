.. An individual record of each pilot used in operations under this subpart, including the following information:
[start=1,lowerroman]
... The full name of the pilot.
... The pilot certificate (by type and number) and ratings that the pilot holds.
... The pilot's aeronautical experience in sufficient detail to determine the pilot's qualifications to pilot aircraft in operations under this subpart.
... The pilot's current duties and the date of the pilot's assignment to those duties.
... The effective date and class of the medical certificate that the pilot holds.
... The date and result of each of the initial and recurrent competency tests and proficiency checks required by this subpart and the type of aircraft flown during that test or check.
... The pilot's flight time in sufficient detail to determine compliance with the flight time limitations of this subpart.
... The pilot's check pilot authorization, if any.
... Any action taken concerning the pilot's release from employment for physical or professional disqualification; and
... The date of the satisfactory completion of initial, transition, upgrade, and differences training and each recurrent training phase required by this subpart.

[start=1,lowerroman]

... The date and result of training required by § 91.1063, as applicable.
.. A current list of all fractional owners and associated aircraft. This list or a reference to its location must be included in the management specifications and should be of sufficient detail to determine the minimum fractional ownership interest of each aircraft.
. Each program manager must keep each record required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section for at least 6 months, and must keep each record required by paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section for at least 12 months. When an employee is no longer employed or affiliated with the program manager or fractional owner, each record required by paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section must be retained for at least 12 months.
. Each program manager is responsible for the preparation and accuracy of a load manifest in duplicate containing information concerning the loading of the aircraft. The manifest must be prepared before each takeoff and must include—
[start=1,arabic]
.. The number of passengers;
.. The total weight of the loaded aircraft;
.. The maximum allowable takeoff weight for that flight;
.. The center of gravity limits;
.. The center of gravity of the loaded aircraft, except that the actual center of gravity need not be computed if the aircraft is loaded according to a loading schedule or other approved method that ensures that the center of gravity of the loaded aircraft is within approved limits. In those cases, an entry must be made on the manifest indicating that the center of gravity is within limits according to a loading schedule or other approved method;
.. The registration number of the aircraft or flight number;
.. The origin and destination; and
.. Identification of crewmembers and their crew position assignments.
. The pilot in command of the aircraft for which a load manifest must be prepared must carry a copy of the completed load manifest in the aircraft to its destination. The program manager must keep copies of completed load manifest for at least 30 days at its principal operations base, or at another location used by it and approved by the Administrator.
. Each program manager is responsible for providing a written document that states the name of the entity having operational control on that flight and the part of this chapter under which the flight is operated. The pilot in command of the aircraft must carry a copy of the document in the aircraft to its destination. The program manager must keep a copy of the document for at least 30 days at its principal operations base, or at another location used by it and approved by the Administrator.
. Records may be kept either in paper or other form acceptable to the Administrator.
. Program managers that are also certificated to operate under part 121 or 135 of this chapter may satisfy the recordkeeping requirements of this section and of § 91.1113 with records maintained to fulfill equivalent obligations under part 121 or 135 of this chapter.
